### A1: Web Scraping & Data Analysis

Books to Scrape is a favorite bookstore platform for domestic audiences and provides you with online book purchase services. At the same time, Books to Scrape also provides you with book name, book price, book rankings, categorical information and other information.

Everyone is interested in good books, how can there be so many good books? So, it is very important to scrape high-quality books on the websites. In this project, we will use the requests and regular expressions we have learned before to scrape all books from the Books to Scrape website. (http://books.toscrape.com/index.html)

##### Task1: 

You are required to scrape 1000 books (all books) from the website and save result into ‘your_name+id.csv’. This file should contain data with the following columns: 

Title of Book / Number of reviews / Rating / Description / Price / Product Type / Book category / availability

##### Task2:

You are required to do a data analysis on the data. What do you think is interesting about this data? Tell a story about some interesting thing you have discovered by looking at the data. 

For example, which one is the book you might read? Does the type of book affect book sales? Which category of books sells the best? What factors affect the inventory of books？ This is an open topic project. You are required to provide a novel topic and demonstrate your hypotheses (view points) with data analysis and figures illustrations.
