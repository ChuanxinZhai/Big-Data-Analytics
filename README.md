### A1: Web Scraping & Data Analysis

Books to Scrape is a favorite bookstore platform for domestic audiences and provides you with online book purchase services. At the same time, Books to Scrape also provides you with book name, book price, book rankings, categorical information and other information.

Everyone is interested in good books, how can there be so many good books? So, it is very important to scrape high-quality books on the websites. In this project, we will use the requests and regular expressions we have learned before to scrape all books from the Books to Scrape website. (http://books.toscrape.com/index.html)

##### Task1: 

You are required to scrape 1000 books (all books) from the website and save result into ‘your_name+id.csv’. This file should contain data with the following columns: 

Title of Book / Number of reviews / Rating / Description / Price / Product Type / Book category / availability

##### Task2:

You are required to do a data analysis on the data. What do you think is interesting about this data? Tell a story about some interesting thing you have discovered by looking at the data. 

For example, which one is the book you might read? Does the type of book affect book sales? Which category of books sells the best? What factors affect the inventory of books？ This is an open topic project. You are required to provide a novel topic and demonstrate your hypotheses (view points) with data analysis and figures illustrations.


### A2: Kaggle

Employee attrition has become a focus of researchers and human resources because of the effects of poor performance on organizations regardless of geography, industry, or size. The goal of the project was to predict if an employee is likely to quit from the job based on a set of data. We used the Kaggle competition " Will your employees leave? " (see https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/int303-big-data-analysis-2223-s1/data) to retrieve necessary data and evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. An IBM’s fictional dataset has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'. For the training set, we are provided with the outcome (whether or not an employee quit). We used this set to build our model to generate predictions for the test set. For each employee in the test set, we have to predict whether or not the employee quit from the job. Our score was the percentage of correct predictions.

##### Task1: 

Create a notebook on Kaggle.     Conduct exploratory data analysis and data processing, train and validate your models, and generate your ‘submission.csv’ on test data using the notebook on Kaggle.     Add necessary comments to your notebook.   Submit your predictions (‘submission.csv’) for the test solution to Kaggle.   Also, you are required to include your Kaggle score in your report (see below in Task 2).

##### Task2:

Write a 1-page report, which must contain 2 or 3 tables or figures. 

The report must cover: 

 Introduction: Why should we care about this technology? How is it related to Big Data?

 Methodology: Data Preprocessing ＆ Classification Algorithm

 Results: Are there benchmarks for its use? How does it compare to similar technology?

 Discussion: What are the good aspects, and what are the bad aspects? Be sure to add a sentence on “contributor thoughts:” What are your own unique thoughts on the pros and cons of the technology? Do you envision an extension that might be helpful? 

 Conclusion: Summarize the 2 to 4 points you think are most important.
